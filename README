This is Toonloop version 2. It is a complete rewrite of the application in 
C++ with Gstreamer. It is still in an alpha stage. 

The Gstreamer GL plugins
------------------------

Toonloop needs gst-plugins-gl, which might not be packaged yet for your 
distribution. Here is how to build and install it:

git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-gl
cd gst-plugins-gl/
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
sudo make install

If running Debian, gstreamer0.10-plugins-gl can be found in the experimental 
repository. If you add "deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian experimental main" 
in your /etc/apt/sources.list and do apt-get update, you should be able to 
find it. Their names are:

 libgstreamer-plugins-gl0.10-0
 gstreamer0.10-plugins-gl
