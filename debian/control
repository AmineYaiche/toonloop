Description: The Toonloop Live Stop Motion Tool 
 .
 Toonloop is a live stop motion animation software. It aims at showing
 the creation process the audience as well as the result of the
 creation. The frame by frame animation is made by adding frames one
 by one to a clip made of many frames. Clips are displayed in a never
 ending loop.
 .
 Toonloop provides features such as onion skinning, and an intervalometer, 
 which allows one to automatically create accelerated time lapse clips. 
 It can be controlled using MIDI input, the Open Sound Control protocol 
 or the FUDI protocol. (with Pure Data) Toonloop offers video effects written 
 in the OpenGL Shading Language, (GLSL) to do chroma keying, luma keying, 
 image adjustements and more. Different themes allow one to choose how the 
 editing and playback viewports are displayed. The configuration can be 
 saved and restored in the JSON format. Finally, Toonloop allows users to 
 save their clips to the photo-JPEG video codec (using mencoder), and as 
 well to JPEG images.
