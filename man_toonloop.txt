[DESCRIPTION]
The Toonloop Live Stop Motion Tool. 

Toonloop is a live stop motion animation software. It aims at showing the creation process the the audience as well as the result of the creation. The frame by frame animation is made by adding frames one by one to a clip made of many frames. Clips are displayed in a never ending loop. 

Toonloop is a great tool to for teaching new medias to children. It can also be used as a professionnal software for movie creators, though it is mainly intended to be used in a live kiosk of show. In the left window, you can see what is seen by the live camera. In the right window, it is the result of the stop motion loop.

Toonloop supports MIDI input, the Open Sound Control protocol, the FUDI protocol (to communicate with Pure Data) and provides a media RSS web server. Currently implemented video effects are : chroma keying using a GLSL shader, onion peal and background image. Toonloop offers state saving in the JSON format. Default config file is ~/.toonloop.json, where tilde (~) is your home directory. Toonloop also allows users to save their clips to the photo-JPEG video codec, and as well to JPEG images. Finally, Toonloop offers an automatic time lapse functionnality, to allow one to easily create accelerated clips. 

[SYNOPSIS]
toonloop [options]

[EXAMPLES]
You can launch Toonloop with a whole bunch of options. Options are set
using the -o flag :

toonloop -o toonloop_home ~/Public/toonloop -o project_name hello -o intervalometer_enabled False -o bgimage_glob_enabled True -o image_flip_horizontal True -o chromakey_on True -o chromakey_on True -o chromakey_r 0.2 -o chromakey_g 0.9 -o chromakey_b 0.0 -o chromakey_thresh 0.5 -o chromakey_slope 0.2 -o fudi_enabled True -w 320 -v

[INTERACTIVE USAGE]

Toonloop is an interactive software. While it runs, or can control it using keyboard keys. Here is a list of keystrokes to control Toonloop.

    <Space bar> = Adds an image to the current clip.
    <Backspace> = Removes an image from the current clip.
    r = Resets the current clip. This erases all the images in it !
    p = Pauses the looping.
    o = Toggles onion skin on / off.
    i = Prints informations and statistics.
    h = Prints an help message.
    s = Saves the current clip as JPEG and movie file.
    a = Enable the intervalometer auto grab.
    k = Increase the intervalometer interval.
    j = Decrease the intervalometer interval.
    x = Saves the current configuration options to ~/.toonloop.json
    [0, 9]  = Selects a clip from the current project identified by a number.
    <Esc> = Quits the program.
    <Up arrow> = Increases the frame rate. (faster)
    <Down arrow> = Decreases the frame rate. (slower)
    <Left arrow> = Moves the write head to the left. (towards the beginning)
    <Right arrow> = Moves the write head to the right. (towards the end)
    <Return> = Moves the write head to the last frame. (at the end)

[OSC INTERFACE]

Toonloop sends the following OSC messages :

  /toon/framerate <i>
  /toon/writehead <i>
  /toon/playhead <i>
  /toon/clip/index <i>
  /sampler/play/start <i>
  /sampler/play/stop <i>
  /sampler/record/start <i>
  /sampler/record/stop <i>

Toonloop listens for the following OSC messages :

  /toon/frame/add
  /toon/frame/remove
  /toon/playhead <i>
  /toon/osc/subscribe <s> <i>
  /toon/clip/select <i>
  /toon/clip/save

[MIDI INTERFACE]

Toonloop can be controlled using a MIDI keyboard. It is best used with a sustain pedal. Control #64 seems to be consistantly mapped to the sustain pedal and is set up to add a frame to the current clip. This can be changed using the keyword configuration options which start with "midi".

[KEYWORD CONFIGURATION OPTIONS] 

The --option command line option allows one to specify specific keyword identified by a keyword. Their type can be integer, float, string of boolean. Boolean options can be given using integer of python-style boolean string. A true value can be specified as True, or 1. A false value is set as 0 or False.

Once Toonloop has been started by some keyword config options, those options can be saved to the ~/.toonloop.json configuration file. Next time Toonloop is launched, those configuration options will be read from that file. If Toonloop behaves strangely, you should try deleting that file. 

Here is the list of options with their default values:
  -o autosave_enabled True
  -o autosave_on False
  -o autosave_rate_seconds 600.0
  -o bgcolor_b 0.2
  -o bgcolor_g 0.8
