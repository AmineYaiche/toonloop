Release notes for Toonloop 1.9.1

This release is an unstable version in the 1.9 series. This version contains new features preparing the 2.0 stable series. Since the 1.2 series, we have done a complete rewrite of the application in C++. In this very specific 1.9.1 release, we drop gst-plugins-gl in favour of Clutter-GST. We removed the support for the --keep-in-ram option, which is used to keep the image data in RAM instead of writing the images to the disk.

New features:
    * Using Clutter!

Bug fixes: 
    * Fixed a segfault when using the "test" or "x" video device.
