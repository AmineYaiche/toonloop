Release notes for Toonloop 1.9.0

This release is an unstable version in the 1.9 series. This version contains new features preparing the 2.0 stable series.

New features:
    * DONE: Choose whether to use SDL, GTK, GTKglext, wxWidgets, or the generic
        one in the gst-plugins-gl/tests/examples. (We chose GTK + Clutter-GST)
    * DONE: Get the pipeline that takes snapshots with gtkpixbufsink done. 
        (it works, just need to save to a proper file name)
    * DONE: prototype: Load images in a gdkpixbuf to create an OpenGL texture 
        and display it.
    * DONE: creates directories (using boost::filesystem)
    * DONE: Use boost::program_options in a similar way to Toonloop 1.x.
    * DONE: Be able to choose the camera input, or the test source. We had to 
        detect the supported FPS by the camera.
    * DONE: Encapsulate the pipeline and the OpenGL rendering in a class.
    * DONE: Resize render area when window is resized.
    * DONE: Use GLEW to check for the OpenGL extensions needed to use shaders.
    * DONE: Save the images in the right directory, with unique names.
    * DONE: Save image files at snapshot time and play from disk. 

Bug fixes: 
    * 51:   Package Boost file_system with autotools 
    * 5:    Resizing the window should resize render area 
    * Memory leak when loading images.
