2010-??-??: Toonloop 2.0.1
--------------------------

This release is a maintenance version in the stable 2.0 series. A stable series means that the command-line options and the interactive keyboard controls should not change much for all tags with 2.0 as major-minor numbers. Some new features might be developped in that branch, but each release should be backward-compatible with their ancestor. The next unstable development branch is 2.1. The next stable series is 2.2. 

This version contains new features and bug fixes. 

New features:
    * Added a help text. (press F1)
    * Adding a bash completion file.
    * Checking for mencoder at runtime

Bug fixes: 
    * Decreased the verbosity a lot.
    * Not checking for mencoder at build time anymore
