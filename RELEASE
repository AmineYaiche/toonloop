2010-12-02 Toonloop 2.1.4 ("pas de deux")
-----------------------------------------

This release is a snapshot in the 2.1 unstable series. 

This version contains new features and bug fixes. 

We have finally implemented again a support for GLSL shader effects. Also, a new info window allows one to view a thumbnail for each clip in a separate display, to ease controlling the looper during a live performance.

New features:
    * Black out when x is pressed
    * Added layout livefeed_only
    * Added the --enable-shaders option
    * Saturation effect (brightness, contrast and saturation)
    * Added a separate window for information. (--enable-info-window)
    * Show a row of thumbnails to represent each clip.
    * black out opacity can be changed

Bug fixes: 
    * Fixed bug with playback not being show at all (since added layout livefeed_only)
    * Using shared_ptr for map of clips
    * Allow up to 40 clips

Notes:
    * If you run toonloop from a directory in your home (not in /usr/local) it might use the midi.xml file in /usr/local, unless you are in the same directory as the executable. Be careful.
