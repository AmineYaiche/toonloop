2010-??-??: Toonloop 2.1.4
--------------------------

This release is a developer snapshot in the 2.1 unstable series. 

This version contains new features and bug fixes. 

New features:
    * Black out when x is pressed
    * Added layout livefeed_only

Bug fixes: 
    * Fixed bug with playback not being show at all (since added layout livefeed_only)

Notes:
    * If you run toonloop from a directory in your home (not in /usr/local) it might use the midi.xml file in /usr/local, unless you are in the same directory as the executable. Be careful.
