--------------------------

This release is a developer snapshot in the 2.1 unstable series. 

This version contains new features and bug fixes. 

New features:
    * XML MIDI bindings configuration file. (controls, notes and program change can send messages to the controller with some arguments)
    * Can now set float, bool and int properties in the Controller
    * It's possible to change the blending mode between each frame in the crossfading. (ADD or NORMAL)
    * improved how info and help text look
    * Displaying FPS, detailled version info and layout name in info text HUD

Bug fixes: 
    * IMPORTANT: Set v4l2 device name before guessing caps. (back-ported to the 2.0.x stable branch)
    * handling interlaced video source (back-ported to the 2.0.x stable branch)
    * Improved MIDI events parsing.
    * Fixed crossafe between each frame. Each frame must fade out, not fade in.
    * Crossfade: the change in opactiry looks better in in-out cubic easing
    * do not crossfade frames if clip size <= 1
    * cleanup in MidiInput constructor
    * decreased verbosity when grabbing video
    * Fixed crash with std::string given a null arg when looking for midi.xml
    * The path to usr/share/toonloop/presets was wrong.
    * Fixed overlay layout: livefeed was behind playback
    * Fixed issue with map_int always returning 0. Simplified Messaging.

Notes:
    If you run toonloop from a directory in your home (not in /usr/local) it might use the midi.xml file in /usr/local, unless you are in the same directory as the executable. Be careful.
