Here is an attempt to figure out the required fields for a system of dynamically loaded GLSL shader effect with some default values for their uniform attributes. 

== Example 1 : cinelike ==
* Effect name: cinelike 
* Description: Decreases the saturation, but increases the contrast, by combining a desaturated image with the original image using the overlay blending mode.

Uniform variables with their default values:
|= Name |=Default Value |=Type |=Range |
| texture | 0 | int | [0, 999] |
| contrast | 1.0 | float | [0.0, 1.0] |
| brightness | 1.0 | float | [0.0, 1.0] |
| saturation | 0.0 | float | [0.0, 1.0] |
| alpha | 1.0 | float | [0.0, 1.0] |
| average_luma | [1.0, 1.0, 1.0] | vec3 | [0.0, 1.0] |
